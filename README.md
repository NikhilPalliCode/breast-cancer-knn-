## 📖 Overview

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. The model is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset and includes comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization components.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** which contains:
- 569 instances with 30 features each
- Features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses
- Target variable: Diagnosis (Malignant/Benign)

Key features include:
- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- Compactness
- Concavity
- Symmetry
- Fractal dimension
